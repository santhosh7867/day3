    <h2><center>BACKGROUND REPEAT</center></h2>
    <div>Zomato (/zoʊmɑtoʊ/) is an Indian multinational restaurant aggregator and food delivery company. It was founded by Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah in 2008.[4] Zomato provides information, menus and user-reviews of restaurants as well as food delivery options from partner restaurants in more than 1,000 Indian cities and towns, as of 2022–23.[5] Zomato rivals Swiggy in food delivery and hyper local space.

        History
        Zomato was founded s FoodieBay in 2008 by Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah who worked for Bain & Company. The website started as a restaurant-listing-and-recommendation portal. They renamed the company Zomato in 2010 as they were unsure if they would "just stick to food" and also to avoid a potential naming conflict with eBay.[6][7][8]
        
        With the introduction of .xxx domains in 2011, Zomato also launched zomato.xxx, a site dedicated to food porn.[9]
        
        In 2011, it expanded across India to Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Pune, Ahmedabad and Hyderabad.[10] In 2012, it expanded operations internationally in several countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Sri Lanka,[11] Qatar,[12] the United Kingdom,[13] the Philippines,[12] and South Africa.[14] In 2013, it expanded in New Zealand,[15] Turkey, Brazil and Indonesia, with website and apps available in Turkish, Portuguese, Indonesian and English languages.[16] In April 2014, it was launched in Portugal, which was followed by launches in Canada, Lebanon and Ireland in 2015.[17][18][19]
        
        In January 2015, Zomato acquired Seattle-based restaurant discovery portal Urbanspoon, which led to the firm's entry into the United States and Australia.[20] This U.S. expansion brought Zomato into direct competition with similar models such as Yelp and Foursquare.[20]
        
        In an effort to expand its business beyond restaurant listing, Zomato started its food delivery service in India in 2015,[21] initially partnering with companies such as Delhivery and Grab to fulfill deliveries from restaurants that did not have their own delivery service.[22]
        
        In April 2015, Zomato acquired the American online table reservation platform NexTable, which was subsequently renamed as Zomato Book.[23] In January 2016, it launched Zomato Book's table reservation feature on its application in India.[24] In April 2015, it acquired cloud-based point of sale (PoS) company MapleGraph Solutions,[25] and, in April 2016, launched its own version of PoS for restaurant owners called Zomato Base, comprising menu and inventory management, payment system and analytics.[26] Later that year, Zomato acquired Sparse Labs (renamed Zomato Trace) and integrated the latter's real-time delivery location tracking technology on its food delivery platform.[27]

        In February 2017, the firm announced plans to launch Zomato Infrastructure Services, a cloud kitchen infrastructure service to help partner restaurants expand their presence without incurring any fixed costs.[28] Later that year, it introduced a paid membership program called Zomato Gold using which subscribers could get offers and discounts on dining and food delivery at Zomato's partner restaurants.[29]
        
        In 2018, Zomato shut down operations of Zomato Infrastructure Services.[30] The company then acquired WOTU and rebranded it as Hyperpure to supply food ingredients such as grains, vegetables and meat to restaurants from its warehouses.[31][32] In December 2018, Zomato launched its annual multi-city food and entertainment carnival called Zomaland.[33]
        
        In March 2019, Zomato sold its UAE food delivery business to Talabat.[34] In September 2019, the firm laid off almost 10% of its workforce (540 people) tending to back-end activities like customer service, merchant and delivery partner support functions.[35]
        
        In April 2020, due to a fall in food delivery and rising demand for online grocery ordering amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Zomato began delivering groceries and essentials under a service named Zomato Market in 80+ cities across India.[36] In April 2020, it introduced contactless dining at its partner restaurants.[37] In May 2020, Zomato also began delivering alcohol in West Bengal, Jharkhand and Odisha after obtaining the permission of the governments in these states.[38] In May 2020, Zomato further laid off 520 employees due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[39]

        Zomato closed operations of Zomato Market in June 2020 as demand for food delivery recovered and grocery delivery business "was not scalable".[40] In April 2021, it pulled out of alcohol delivery service citing poor unit economics and scalability</div>
